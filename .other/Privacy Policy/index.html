      <p>
        Some of the information you provide to us, such as your name, company name, postal address, email address, credit card information or telephone number, may allow you to be identified. We call this kind of information “Personally Identifiable Information.” We may use your Personally Identifiable Information for the purpose of communicating with you, responding to your inquiries, providing service updates, delivering promotions, sending you e-newsletters, and as otherwise detailed below in this Privacy Policy.

      </p>
      <p>Data protection is of a particularly high priority for the management of House of Watkins, LLC. Viewing our website is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If the processing of personal data is necessary we obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
      <p>House of Watkins, LLC has implemented a number of high-quality technical and organizational measures to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However, Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be guaranteed. For this reason, if you prefer, you can bypass the internet all together and transfer personal data to us via alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
